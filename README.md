# AutoSelfBot
A Discord SelfBot that works out of the box.

## Explanation
Discord condemns selfbot's as well as general account stealing so they make getting user tokens somewhat difficult. Using duxe's WebSocket based Discord token grabber we can automatically grab the user's token and pipe it into a bot. Not really useful for a developer, but maybe those nerds who sell selfbots might use it.
